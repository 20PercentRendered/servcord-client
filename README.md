# Servcord Client
A fully customizable Discord client that feels like the official client. 
Has support for connecting to self-hosted servers.
Primarily intended for Servcord.
Works on Windows, (Mac?) and Linux.

## Usage
Currently unusable. :(
## Development
Basically everything is in the renderer folder, for stuff to do look
at the project boards. Try to abide by ESLint rules (except in placeholders.ts) and create only
class-based react components.

## Building
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm i --also-dev`
3. `npm run dev`
